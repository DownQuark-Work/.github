# DownQuark

## Where the work philosophy mirrors the dance of subatomic particles.

Dynamically choose our projects allows us to phase out structured timelines and focus on the realm of productivity.
Adhering to our current build as long as it remains intriguing. 
This could consist of completing a singular task in a day or crafting multiple features over a span of weeks.

That's the rhythm of DownQuarkâ€¦ at work.

## Why this approach? 
Because it works for us. 

Without clients or looming deadlines, we're free to delve into ideas we believe in. 
Our commitment runs deep, and we strive to maintain the utmost level of quality as we bring these ideas to life. 
Success in this endeavor hinges significantly on avoiding burnout. 

However, steering clear of mental collapse is a delicate balance.
Focusing solely on internal projects demands ongoing progress, further restricting the amount of available time away from the grind. 
The closest we've come to a remedy is acheived by perpetually keeping a variety of projects in motion.

Allowing progress to be consistently achievable. 
It's not uncommon to dive into database queries at the start of the day and find ourselves immersed in the act of pushing pixels within a design application by day's end.
